🌍 Global Water Consumption (2000–2024)

📖 Description
This project analyzes the dataset [Global Water Consumption (2000–2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-water-consumption-dataset-2000-2024), which contains information on global water consumption, broken down by country and by type of use:  

- 💧 Agricultural Water Use (%)  
- 🏭 Industrial Water Use (%)  
- 🏠 Household Water Use (%) 

The goal is to study the evolution of water consumption over time, identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, and create visualizations to support analysis and communication of the results.

📊 Conducted Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (dataset size, missing values, distributions).  
- Trends in **total water consumption** over time by country.  
- Percentage distribution of agricultural, industrial, and household water use.  
- Relationship between annual precipitation and groundwater depletion rate.  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each country.  
- Highlighting countries with extreme consumption or anomalous trends.
